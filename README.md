Github Usage
============

Create a simple web application that displays statistics on a user’s github activity:

- Allow the end-user to enter a github handle
- Retrieve said user’s public github activity using the github api
- Display summary statistics, showing in particular:
  - the number of total commits across repos
  - number of repos committed to on a weekly basis
  - any other key statistics you find interesting.
- We’d suggest a graphical representation using D3.js, but feel free to use 
  another tool if you prefer. 
- Display the repo(s) that seems to be the most interesting (and define what makes a 
  repo “interesting”). If you can illustrate it for the end-user, that’s even better.
